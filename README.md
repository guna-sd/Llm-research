### Llm-research
Researching efficient and high-performing Language Model (LLM) architectures.

Welcome to the LLM Research Repository! This repository is dedicated to the exploration and research of Language Models (LLMs) 
with a focus on achieving efficiency without compromising performance.
Focusing on optimizing models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks without compromising performance.

#### ModelX: 
The repository contains Re-implementations of various LLM architectures, each designed to strike a balance between efficiency and performance.

#### Model:
The repository contains actual implementations of various LLM architectures.
